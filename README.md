🚢 Titanic Dataset EDA | SkillCraft Internship Task 02
📌 Task Overview
Task 02:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice — such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The objective is to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

📂 Dataset
We will use the famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. It includes information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

🧼 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, etc.) into numerical values using encoding techniques.

Removed or imputed inconsistent values.

Checked for duplicates and outliers.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed detailed EDA using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Key insights:

Survival Rate: Explored survival distribution across gender, class, and age.

Gender Impact: Females had a higher survival rate than males.

Pclass: Passengers in 1st class had higher chances of survival.

Age Groups: Children and young adults had better chances than elderly passengers.

Correlation Heatmap: Analyzed the correlation between all features.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📈 Sample Visuals

Age Distribution by Survival Status (Histogram)

Heatmap of Feature Correlations

📌 Conclusion
This EDA provided valuable insights into the Titanic dataset, such as which groups were more likely to survive. This kind of analysis is crucial before building any predictive model and is a key step in any data science workflow.
